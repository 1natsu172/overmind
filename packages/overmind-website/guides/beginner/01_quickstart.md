# Quickstart

From the command line install the Overmind package and the devtools:

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/quickstart/install" })
```

It is highly recommended to install the package [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently). It allows you to start the devtools as you start your build process:

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/quickstart/install_devtools" })
```

Now set up a simple application like this and you are off to the races!

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/quickstart/simple_app" })
```

When you now fire up your application the devtools should show the state. To get going with your app please follow the next guides.

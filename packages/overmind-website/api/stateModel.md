# StateModel

If you prefer to model your state as a class you can use the **StateModel** base class. This is a class that Overmind is able to recognize to give you the reactive functionality as expected. This class also ensures that the devtools is able to present it correctly.

h(Example, { name: "guide/definingstate/statemodel" })
